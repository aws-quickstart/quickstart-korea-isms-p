image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture,width=100%,height=100%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A bastion host in a public subnet that enables system administrator access and connection via Secure Shell (SSH) for troubleshooting EC2 instances.
* Deploying a multi-service Availability Zone (AZ) architecture with the management and production VPC for web and apps consisting of the public (front) and private (back-end) subnets for web, apps, and databases.
* Standard security groups for EC2 instances.
* Default AWS Identity and Access Management configurations that include groups, roles, and instance profiles as well as customizable IAM policies.
* AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for CloudTrail and RDS key encryption.
* Rules to examine encryption policies.
* Amazon GuardDuty to identify external intrusion threats.
* Notification policies based on SNS topics to capture RDS CPU/Storage alarms.
* Defining and deploying AWS Config rules to monitor security policies and compliance.
* AWS WAF that creates response rules (Core Rule, WordPress, Application, SQL database, PHP application) automatically against the vulnerabilities of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top Ten.
* Separate Auto Scaling groups for web and apps to secure high availability, and the three-tier web application (WordPress) that supports Application Load Balancers.
* S3 buckets for centralized logging and AWS WAF.
* Redundant Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) in a multi-AZ configuration.
* AWS-managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to control public network access by the resources in the private subnets.
