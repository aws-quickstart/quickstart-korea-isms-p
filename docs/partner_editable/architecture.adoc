.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture,width=100%,height=100%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A multi-service Availability Zone (AZ) architecture with management and production VPCs
** In the management VPC, a bastion host in a public subnet that enables system administrator access and connection via Secure Shell (SSH) for troubleshooting EC2 instances.
** In the production VPC, web and application instances with public (front-end) and private (back-end) subnets for web, application, and database layers.
* Standard security groups for EC2 instances.
* Default AWS Identity and Access Management configurations that include groups, roles, and instance profiles as well as customizable IAM policies.
* AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for CloudTrail and RDS key encryption.
* Rules to examine encryption policies.
* Amazon GuardDuty to identify external intrusion threats.
* Notification policies based on SNS topics to capture RDS CPU/Storage alarms.
* AWS Config rules to monitor security policies and compliance.
* An AWS WAF that creates response rules (Core Rule, WordPress, Application, SQL database, PHP application) automatically against the top tem Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) vulnerabilities.
* Separate Auto Scaling groups for web and application instances to secure high availability, and a three-tier web application (WordPress) that supports Application Load Balancers.
* S3 buckets for centralized logging and AWS WAF.
* A redundant Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) database in a multi-AZ configuration.
* AWS-managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to control public network access by the resources in the private subnets.
* 11 CloudWatch metric filters and alarms with following topics:
