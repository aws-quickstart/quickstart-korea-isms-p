// Add any tips or answers to anticipated questions. This could include the following troubleshooting information. If you don’t have any other Q&A to add, change “FAQ” to “Troubleshooting.”

== Troubleshooting

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console on the *Configure stack options* page. With this setting, the stack’s state is retained and the instance is left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)
// If you’re deploying on Linux instances, provide the location for log files on Linux, or omit this sentence.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^] on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size-limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* Launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas] on the AWS website.


*Q.* A warning message appears when accessing the landing page.

*A.* Different browsers may display different warning messages due to HTTPS protocols that use private certificates. You can bypass the warning by choosing *Accept* or opening an *Advanced* page with additional options.


*Q.* I failed to create the stack because an Amazon GuardDuty detector already exists in my AWS account.

*A.* Disable Amazon GuardDuty in the Region where you want to deploy the Quick Start, or delete the GuardDuty detector from the CloudFormation template.


*Q.* I failed to create the stack because AWS Config was disabled in my AWS account.

*A.* Enable AWS Config in a Region where you want to deploy the Quick Start. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ko_kr/config/latest/developerguide/gs-console.html[Setting up AWS Config through the console] for more information.


*Q.* I want to set up notifications but didn’t receive an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) subscription email.

*A.* When prompted during the Quick Start deployment process, confirm that you entered the email address correctly in the *NotificationList* field in the stack details. If the address is incorrect, choose the *Update* tab of the stack, replace the address with the correct one, and deploy the stack again.


*Q.* I deleted the CloudFormation stack after deployment but some resources remain undeleted.

*A.* You can check the messages displayed on the *Events* tab of the stack, or you can identify the resources created with the Quick Start template deployment and delete them manually. See the link:#_technical_requirements[Technical requirements] section for a list of resources used in this deployment.

*Q.* What topics are used for the Amazon CloudWatch metric filters and alarms?
